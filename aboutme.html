          <h1>Welcome!</h1>
          <h3>I am currently a seinor at Baruch College, studying Computer Information system</h3>
          <p>I am currently focusing on becoming a software engineer and information security professional. My passion in technology comes from my goal to build my own startup and learning about disruptive technology. I use my personal time to learn about the stock market and how market moves based on global events. The companies I like to follow in the market are Apple, Irobot, Netflix, Boeing, Palo Alto Networks, Blackrock and more. I use my personal time to practice martial arts such as Muay Thai and Wushu. I began training in 2011, where I first joined a Karate Dojo but after a year I took up Kickboxing. After Kickboxing, I found Wushu and started to learning how to use the sword. I found that to be really interesting but physically demanding and I wanted to learn hand to hand combat so I took up Muay thai at International Training Center. I hope to continue learning martial arts and expanding my development skills! </p>
